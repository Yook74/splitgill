# splitgill: A utility for making donation receipts in LaTeX
Named for split-gill fungi which can communicate with each other.

I operate a nonprofit electronics refurbishing and recycling organization called Hypha Upcycling.
Sometimes people donate material to Hypha which is very kind of them, and I'm obligated to give them a receipt.
Of course this receipt should be auto generated by python and rendered by LaTeX.

There wasn't really another option was there?
